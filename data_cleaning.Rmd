### About this site

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r Zander Test, eval = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
trees_2015 = read_csv("large_tree_data/2015_tree_raw.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

tree_alive_test = trees_2015 |> 
  filter(status == "Alive") |> 
  count(status)
```



```{r, eval = FALSE}
tree_raw <- read_csv("large_tree_data/2015_tree_raw.csv", col_names = TRUE, na = c("", "NA", "Unknown"))

tree_clean <- tree_raw |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

head(tree_clean)

str(tree_clean)

tree_clean |> 
  count(status)



```
