### Air Pollutants and Tree Distribution
The EPA and Leading Forest Agencies discuss that one of the ecosystem benefits of urban street trees is the ability for trees to uptake fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from vehicle exhaust and local combustion through stomata uptake during photosynthesis. https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/ESC/PercentparticulatematterPM25removedannuallybytreecover.pdf
