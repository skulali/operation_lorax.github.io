Tree Status: Assess whether trees being along or offset from the curb or protected by the guardrail are related to their health, damage amount, or whether they are alive.

```{r}

# Here we are going to explore whether being along or offset from the curb, or protected by a guardrail, affects the tree health, whether the trees are alive, and other tree details. We will do this statistically with chi-square tests and visualize the ratios with bar plots of the percentages. 

# First get a smaller dataframe with only the relevant columns, and rename/reformat them so that the labels on the figure are nice.
