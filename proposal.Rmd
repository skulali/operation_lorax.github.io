## Project title

## Motivation 
There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of green space exposure on human health ([Yang et al., 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479545/)). To better inform public health interventions, researchers are diving deeper into the specific aspects of nature, such as urban trees, and their effects on health. Most studies have observed positive effects of urban trees on physical activity and a collection of health outcomes, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and mental health ([Wolf et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345658/)). However, validation of these results and further exploration of additional health outcomes is needed. In addition, few studies have examined how urban tree exposure may differ across sociodemographic groups ([Wolf et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345658/)). Here, we focus on New York City using tree data from 2015 (most recent dataset). In this study, we aim to examine the geographic distribution of trees across NYC neighborhoods and potential associations with sociodemographic variables and health outcomes, primarily at the NTA (neighborhood tabulation area as defined by the 2010 census) resolution. Such research will aid in informing public health interventions to promote equitable access to urban trees and improve health. While our analyses are retrospective, our work will lay a foundation that can be used as a comparison point when the next tree census is realeased in 2025, allowing researchers to see how trends may have changed between 2015 and 2025.
