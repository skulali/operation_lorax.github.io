### Project title

### Motivation

There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects
of green space exposure on human health ([Yang et al.,
2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479545/)). To better
inform public health interventions, researchers are diving deeper into
the specific aspects of nature, such as urban trees, and their effects
on health. Most studies have observed positive effects of urban trees on
physical activity and a collection of health outcomes, including
respiratory, cardiovascular, and mental health ([Wolf et al.,
2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345658/)). However,
validation of these results and further exploration of additional health
outcomes is needed. In addition, few studies have examined how urban
tree exposure may differ across sociodemographic groups ([Wolf et al.,
2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345658/)). Here, we
focus on New York City using tree data from 2015 (most recent dataset).
In this study, we aim to examine the geographic distribution of trees
across NYC and potential associations with sociodemographic variables
and health outcomes, at the zipcode and/or borough resolution. Such
research will aid in informing public health interventions to promote
equitable access to urban trees and improve health.
